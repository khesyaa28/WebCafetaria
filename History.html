        <h2 style="font-family: copperplate;">Our Coffe Company</h2>
        <h4>Their Story - Two of the owners spend the winter in San Cristobal de las Casas, Mexico. San Cristobal is in the State of Chiapas, the southwestern most state of Mexico, 
            high in the mountains at 7,000 feet. In the lowlands surrounding the mountains, some of the finest chocolate and coffee in the world is grown by small, family owned farms. This lead to the creation of the Acadia Coffee Company. 
            Our goal at Acadia Coffee Company is to buy organic coffee at a fair market price direct from co-ops or the farmers themselves and bring it to you here in the United States. We will not only focus on where we are getting the chocolate and coffee but of course on how we are preparing it for you at our café.
             Only the highest quality equipment is used and hours of training is required of our baristas 
             before they are ready to pull a shot of espresso for you. Eventually we hope to have 100% of our chocolate coming from Chiapas and a majority of our coffees, although we intend to continue to offer high quality gourmet coffees from around the world as well.</h4>
